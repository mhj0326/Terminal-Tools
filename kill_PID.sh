kill -9 PID
The kill -9 command is used to forcefully terminate a process in Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux or macOS). Here's what it does:
ps -p [PID] -o user=

kill: This command sends a signal to a process, instructing it to perform a certain action, typically to terminate.
-9 (SIGKILL): This is the signal number that tells the operating system to immediately and forcefully stop the process. The -9 signal (also known as SIGKILL) cannot be ignored or handled by the process, ensuring that the process is killed instantly.
In summary, kill -9 is a command used to forcefully kill processes that may not be responding to other signals or are stuck in a state where they cannot terminate normally.
